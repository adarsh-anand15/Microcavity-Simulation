Description:  
This Application simulates the behaviour of a Distributed Bragg Reflector and a Microcavity made of two DBRs.  
It can give Reflectance profile, and Electric field profile for a single DBR as well as a Microcavirt made of two DBRs.  
It also simulates Energy Band Dispersion Relation for a bare Microcavity.
  
Requirements:  
You will need MATLAB 2017a or higher to run this app.  
  
Steps to Run:  
1 - Download all the files in the repository and save them in same folder.  
2 - Open "Microcavity_Simulation.mlapp" file with MATLAB and run it.  
  
To install as standalone application for Windows with Matlab runtime already installed:  
1 - Go to folder : Microcavity_Simulation\for_redistribution  
2 - Run the file : MyAppInstaller_web
